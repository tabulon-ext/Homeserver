# Switching to Bluefin OS (Fedora Silverblue based), attempting to use podman instead of docker
# So far, after a clean install, these are the required steps

# Change hostname, note you can also just do this in Settings

Basics after a new laptop/pc install (Gnome based Linux): 

1. After setup is completed, dont do anything else but this first:
https://github.com/zilexa/Bluefin-Gnome-Intuitive follow the instructions. 
Reboot afterwards!

After the reboot, do the bare basics:
2. Go to Settings > System > Region
   > Change Formats to your region. 
3. Settings > System > About 
   > Change your device name
4. Settings > System > Remote Desktop
   > Enable Desktop Sharing & Remote Control
   > Set a password you remember
5. Settings System > SSH
   > Enable SSH
6. Settings > Power 
   > Disable Suspend when plugged in if this is a device that will be running 24x7

Now set up Tailscale, make sure you are logged into Tailscale in the browser already (or create an account, just use Google to login). 
7. Go to Apps > Extensions
   > Find TailscaleQS
   > Hit the tiny arrow at the right to see its description.
   > Note it says to run a command first.
   > Open Terminal app, type over that command and run it. 
8. > Now you can run `tailscale up` and it will give you an URL to login. When done:
   > Go to the system tray, hit the arrow next to Tailscale > Settings. 
   > Enable "Allow LAN Access". The rest disabled. 

9. Tailscale Exit Node: If this is your homeserver/nas that will be running 24x7, you can use it as a Tailscale Exit Node, and optionally allow other devices to tunnel
   their traffic through this server (for example: to share Netflix). This turns your system into a VPN Tunnel endpoint (like a paid VPN service does). 
   This is NOT needed for other devices to access services running on this server. But its a nice to have option:
   > run: tailscale set --advertise-exit-node
   > go on the web to tailscale.com and login to admin console, there you can Approve your device as exit node. 
   > You need to also run: tailscale set --advertise-routes=192.168.1.0/24
   > and probably accept this in the webUI. 
   > Now go to the system tray, make sure "Allow LAN Access" and "Accept Routes" are enabled. Make sure "Allow DNS" is disabled since you dont need adfiltering. 
   Note: "Accept Routes" only needs to be enabled if you set this device up as Exit Node. Otherwise leave it disabled.

Extra handy:
10. Allow services running under current user to linger after logout:
   > loginctl enable-linger $USER

Docker like you are used to: 
11. Setup docker: 
   > ujust dx-group 
   If this is incorrect just run "ujust", the list of scripts will be shown, find the one with the description saying it sets up docker.

SELinux:
12. Change SELinux to permissive mode (you will get warnings but wont be blocked)
> sudo nano /etc/selinux/config
> change to SELINUX=permissive

Save changes and reboot. 

## Enable GPU access for hardware accelerated video transcoding (for Jellyfin) Probalby not neccessary:
sudo setsebool -P container_use_dri_devices 1

# Add registry for docker images
##mkdir $HOME/.config/containers/
##cp /etc/containers/registries.conf $HOME/.config/containers/

# Lower privileged ports
##sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/podman-privileged-ports.conf
# add net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80 to this file
# Apply change:
##sudo sysctl --load /etc/sysctl.d/podman-privileged-ports.conf


# To manage containers via Cockpit, note this is optional and should NOT be used! Just use Podman Desktop isntead!!
## rpm-ostree install cockpit-system cockpit-ws cockpit-files cockpit-networkmanager cockpit-ostree cockpit-podman cockpit-selinux cockpit-storaged
# REBOOT!
# Configure cockpit
##sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
##sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit
##sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
##sudo setsebool -P nis_enabled 1

# Configure podman
##systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
